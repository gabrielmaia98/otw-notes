# Notes for my playthrough of OTW's bandit 

ATTENTION: you are supposed to solve this by yourself, not to look at solutions. Don't cheat on your learning.

I am excited for this one, as I want to advance my skills on the command line and become comfortable with ssh. I will also be learning to use tmux basic functionalities, so I will be taking notes of this here as well.

My guide to tmux will be c-b ? and some random resources online.

## Level 0 -> 1 

### Objectives:

The goal of this level was to learn the basics of ssh, basically accessing the server with the password provided. 

### Notes / Observations:

The intro to user commands was a good read, I didn't know about the `info` command yet. Besides that, I read the ssh wikipedia page and the wikihow tutorial. Really straightforward, but I still don't understand public key authentication, so I hope to study it properly one day. 

### Commands used:

- ̀`ssh`
- `cat`

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
```

```bash
cat readme 
```

### Extras:

    Tmux:
        c-b + [ was really useful to read the long output.

## Level 1 -> 2 

The concept of dashed filename was useful here as it is a special character for the sheel. I had to explicitly specify the relative path of the file in order for commands to work as intended.
